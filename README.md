# MultivariateLinearRegression

- Unfortunately due to the lack of GPUs available, I am unable to branch out and start doing proper ML And deep learning tasks.

This is a simple project designed so everyone can understand how to write a similar script. 

This project uses Multivarite Linear Regresion to fit a "line of best fit" to our data so it can estimate a value for our desired data (In this projects case, lif expectancy) 

The Mathematics in this project is tied up in prewritten functions however it is faily simple to understand.

^ As you can see just a simple multivariable linear regression algorithm is being run
